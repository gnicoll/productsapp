## A Front End code demonstration  by Glenn Nicoll.

I choose to implement this task using AngularJS (1.6.9) due to my familiarity with this framework. 
AngularJS is the only external resource used.

To run the demonstration:
Download/pull all files into a directory and view the directory on any webserver.

Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (AngularJS)
* Photoshop (for image splicing from provided template psd)


Thank you for this opportunity.
